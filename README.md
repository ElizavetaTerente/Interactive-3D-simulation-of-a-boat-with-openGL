# Interactive-3D-simulation-of-a-boat-with-openGL 

Interactive 3D simulation of a boat features realistic water flow and dynamic day/night lighting modes. The boat floats naturally on water and can be controlled using keyboard input. User can freely adjust the camera to view the boat from any angle.

## Controls & Interactive Usage

You can interact with the scene using both keyboard and mouse inputs:

### Camera Controls
- `0` – Reset camera to orbit mode, looking at the center
- `1` – Detach camera from boat (free view)
- `2` – Attach camera to follow the boat

### Lighting & Shading
- `C` – Toggle Blinn-Phong shading (on/off)
- `B` – Toggle binary search refinement for reflections (on/off)
- `N` – Switch to **night mode** lighting
- `M` – Switch to **day mode** lighting
- `L` – Toggle boat's spotlight (on/off)

### Boat Controls
- `W` – Increase throttle (move forward)
- `S` – Decrease throttle (move backward)
- `A` – Steer left
- `D` – Steer right

### Miscellaneous
- `P` – Take a screenshot and save as `screenshot.png`
- `ESC` – Exit the program

### Mouse Controls
- **Left Mouse Button** (hold + drag) – Orbit the camera around the scene
- **Mouse Scroll Wheel** – Zoom in/out (adjust camera distance)

## Technical Details

- **Language:** C++ with GLSL for shaders  
- **Graphics API:** OpenGL  
- **Shader Techniques:**  
  - Reflection vector computation  
  - View-space ray marching  
  - Depth buffer comparison  
- **Optimizations:**  
  - Binary search refinement for accurate intersection detection  
  - Linear interpolation for smooth texture sampling
 
 ## How to Run the Project
